# chdb-d examples

Several examples that are showing how to work with `chdb-d` and different file formats:
- simplest Session
- local CSV file
- local Parquet file
- remote Parquet file

### Running example

To run example you need to clone the repo and use command in the folder of example:
```bash
dub run
```

If you want to use example separately don't forget to change the dub file.
You can create it with the logic:
1. `dub init`
2. `dub add chdb-d`
3. `dub build` or `dub run`
